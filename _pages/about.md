A Ph.D. computer science student and a research assistant. Also, an opensource developer who tries to make the open-science dream come true. Plus that, I enjoy watching movies and rate them in my IMDB list.

**Research at USC 🔴🟡**

As a Research Assistant, I'm part of the ACE lab, under the supervision of Souti (Rini) Chattopadhyay. We're working on solutions and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of human-computer interaction. BTW, our main focus is on software developers.

**Open Source Enthusiast 🌐❤️**

When the clock strikes "free time," I become an open-source developer! I'm a staunch advocate for collaboration and shared knowledge, which is why I'm always contributing to open-source projects. You'll find my coding escapades on my GitHub profile, where I join forces with tech-savvy allies to create and improve open-source software. 🦸‍♂️💻


Thanks for dropping by my page, and remember, in the world of tech, the fun never ends! 🎉🚀🤓

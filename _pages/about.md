Hey stranger, this is Sadra. I‚Äôm currently studying my PhD in Computer Science at USC, working at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), i.e., making LLMs better friends of humans.
My current research focuses on helping people make better decisions using LLMs.
On the side (and honestly, all the time), I build and maintain scientific software tools with a great team of open-source enthusiasts.
I‚Äôm always looking for ways to make technology and science more accessible, and fun‚Äîbelieving that open-source software is an ideal contribution to scientific communities that value transparency and reproducibility.
I enjoy watching movies and hunting for new places whenever I travel in my free time.
I'm always curious to meet new people and hear about their journeys, so shoot me an email or DM me on any social media!

The main problem I'm trying to solve is the integration of AI systems into human workflows‚Äîspecifically, answering the question: "What is the core part of a task that AI cannot do, and how can AI assist humans in doing that?"
Helping humans tackle the hardest parts of their jobs‚Äîwith AI as a consultant‚Äîis the overarching meta-goal of my current research.
To address this, I've explored several domains where large language models (LLMs) have been introduced but face full-integration challenges. These include software developers trusting code agents for programming, strategic decision-making in the board game Diplomacy, and patients navigating conflicting medical advice.
<br>
I'm currently in my second year and looking forward to exploring more domains to develop a taxonomy of these challenges and a framework that identifies the right interaction patterns and integration points for AI.
Throughout this journey, I've had the great opportunity to work with the Adaptive Computing Experience (ACE) Lab (Souti Chattopadhyay‚Äôs lab @ GCS) and [CUTE LAB NAME] (Jonathan May‚Äôs lab @ ISI).

    We investigate how developers define, evaluate, and evolve trust in AI-generated code suggestions through a mixed-method study involving surveys and observations. We found that while comprehensibility and perceived correctness are key to trust decisions, developers often revise their choices, accepting only 52% of AI suggestions, highlighting the need for better real-time support and offering four validated guidelines to improve developer-AI collaboration.

    We investigate how well language models adapt explanations to learners with varying educational backgrounds using ELI-Why, a benchmark of 13.4K "Why" questions. Through two human studies, we found that GPT-4 explanations align with intended grade levels only 50% of the time and are rated 20% less suitable for learners‚Äô needs compared to layperson-curated responses, revealing limitations in their pedagogical adaptability.

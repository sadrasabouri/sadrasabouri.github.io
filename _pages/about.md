I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science exploring how to make human-LLM interactions more engaging, especially for decision-making. I'm also an open-source developer passionate about advancing open science. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies.


**Research at USC üî¥üü°**

As a Research Assistant, I'm part of the Adaptive Computing Experience (ACE) lab, under the supervision of Souti (Rini) Chattopadhyay. We're working on pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of human-computer interaction with main focus on LLMs.


**Open Source Enthusiast üåê**

In my free time, I become an open-source software developer! I'm an advocate for collaboration and shared knowledge. You'll find more about my open-source activities on my GitHub profile. Following that I co-founded [OpenSciLab](https://openscilab.com/) as a community for open science.

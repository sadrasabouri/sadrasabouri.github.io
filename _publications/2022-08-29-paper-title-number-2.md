excerpt: 'Huge corpora of textual data are always known to be a crucial need for training deep models such as transformer-based ones. This issue is emerging more in lower resource languages - like Farsi. We propose naab, the biggest cleaned and ready-to-use open-source textual corpus in Farsi. It contains about 130GB of data, 250 million paragraphs, and 15 billion words. The project name is derived from the Farsi word NAAB K which means pure and high grade. We also provide the raw version of the corpus called naab-raw and an easy-to-use preprocessor that can be employed by those who wanted to make a customized corpus.'

In this talk, I present our team's findings on trustworthy AI code generation at the USC-Amazon 3rd Annual Symposium. Our research focused on exploring the psychological trust dynamics between programmers and AI code assistants. We examined how developers perceive and rely on AI-generated code, the factors that influence their trust, and strategies for enhancing the reliability and transparency of AI tools by surveying 27 computer science students and an observational study over 10 software developers.

The talk highlights key insights from our project, offering a deeper understanding of how trust is built and maintained in the context of AI-driven code generation.

## DSCI552 - Machine Learning for Data Science
### (Prof. Mohammad Reza Rajati)
I served as a teaching assistant for this course, where I was responsible for grading assignments, crafting exam questions, and holding regular office hours to support students. With 80 students enrolled, I worked alongside a team of 12 teaching assistants to ensure smooth course delivery.
